# Basic Information

This is the guide for *Track and Plan Your Cash Flows* (abbreviated TAPYOURCASH), which essentially is a spreadsheet file which is yet to be published.
It is made in LibreOffice Calc.

This repo is just for its guide, a PDF-file.
That file is not included either, but can be built by using LaTeX.

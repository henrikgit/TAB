	Foreword\\
	\begin{minipage}[t]{0.8\columnwidth}\small
		In this guide, I try to convey knowledge via tips, explanations and ``rules''.
		But please regard all that as \emph{suggestions}--do what works best for you!
		Since it is a free file, you are obviously going to create your own copy of it so you might as well get into the details and change up a few things.\footnote{In this case I would very much like to receive some feedback of course. :) More on that in \autoref{sec:feedback}, p.~\pageref{sec:feedback}.}
		Do not worry if you think it is a bit much at first glance, you are most definitely going to get a better understanding in time.

While I would like to say that the file is pretty solid and works alright, its value is clearly dependent on the content it serves.
If you find that some tracking categories are missing or its structure overall should be changed, it is on you to adjust some sheets.
\begin{itemize}
	\item For adding or removing tracking categories to your liking, consult \autoref{subsec:editing-tracking-categories}.
	\item For changing the order/structure of said categories, go to \autoref{subsec:editing-order-of-tracking-categories}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Editing Sheets in General}
\label{subsec:editing-general-sheet-editing}

You can simply go ahead and do one of the following things:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Rename a sheet.
	\loc will ``see'' that new name and use it automatically in a formula, if you have already referenced a cell in that sheet in a formula.
	This means you will not have to update any existing formulas which were using the just-changed sheet name.
	\item Change the order of the sheets.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Editing Tracking Categories}
\label{subsec:editing-tracking-categories}

When you want to edit anything in regards to the categories, you must start with the tracking categories.

\subsubsection{Renaming a Tracking Category}
\label{subsubsec:renaming-a-tracking-category}

If you want to rename a tracking category, you must work through the following bullet points:
\begin{itemize}
	\item If you rename the tracking category, you must rework the entries you made in the the  \ac{bic} \sterm{Category}!
	Obviously the whole tracking and budgeting aspect only makes sense if these category names in both sheets match.
	For more, go back to \autoref{subsubsec:bic-category} on \autopageref{subsubsec:bic-category}.
	\item Other than that, there is no need to change Calc's formulas, as described in \autoref{subsec:editing-general-sheet-editing}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Adding a Tracking Category Or Tracking Section}
\label{subsubsec:adding-a-tracking-category-section}

With \tfn being open and accessible, you can easily add a category or whole section for tracking purposes.
For this, work through the following list:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Go to the relevant row in the sheet \sheetname{Tracker}.
	\item In case you are not aware, there are 2 ways to insert a row:
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Left-click on any content and then use the keyboard shortcut \keystroke{CTRL}+\keystroke{+} (the plus sign).
		Then click on the 3rd entry from the top, which says \codestuff{Entire Row}.
		The row gets then inserted \sterm{above} the highlighted row.
		\item Right-click on the row number (by that I mean the actual number from \loc's GUI which is highlighted) and then on \codestuff{Insert Rows Above} or \codestuff{Insert Row Below}.
	\end{enumerate}
	\item You can enter the new name.
	\item If you just created a new tracking category, you most likely still have to create a new sheet.
	For naming that sheet, please consider the advice from \autoref{subsec:tracking-categories}, \autopageref{subsec:tracking-categories}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Removing a Tracking Catergory or Tracking Section}
\label{subsubsec:removing-a-tracking-category-section}

For removing a tracking category or a whole section, I believe there is no extra section necessary and I hope it is sufficient to point you \autoref{subsubsec:adding-a-tracking-category-section}.
Simply apply the steps from there in analogical fashion.

\subsubsection{Correcting Formula References}
\label{subsubsec:correct-formula-references}

Once you changed the number of rows in the sheet \sheetname{Tracker}, you must correct the references in all sheets which rely on the system of the categories.
These include:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Hier\todo{weiter}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Editing The Order of Tracking Categories}
\label{subsec:editing-order-of-tracking-categories}

If you would like to have a different order of the tracking categories in the sheets \sheetname{Tracker} and \sheetname{Budget}, you 
Editing the order of tracking categories builds upon \autoref{subsec:editing-tracking-categories} and is basically the same.

\subsection{Editing Budgeting Sheets}
\label{subsec:editing-budgeting-sheets}

\subsection{Editing Budgeting Categories}
\label{subsec:editing-categories-for-budgeting}

As stated in \autoref{subsubsec:bic-category}, \autopageref{subsubsec:bic-category}, writing something in the \ac{bic} ``Category'' is rather selecting an entry in a given list than literally writing something.
For this list to change in terms of budgeting categories, there are no extra steps.
As stated in \autoref{subsec:tracking-categories}, the budgeting categories are simply mirroring the tracking categories, hence for all things ``editing budgeting categories'' you must work through \autoref{subsec:editing-tracking-categories}.

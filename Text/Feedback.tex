% !TeX spellcheck = en_US

I welcome any feedback, but of course the most favorable kind would be specific and constructive feedback.
You can reach me at \codestuff{henrik.finanzen@gmail.com}.
%Regardless, I am very open to hear any thoughts on the file.
%\begin{itemize}
%	\item Is there something missing?
%	\item Is there something wrong?
%	\item Is something not working (as intended)?
%	\item Is something really good?
%\end{itemize}

%To preempt a suggestion I have already gotten elsewhere: as of this point, I do not think that implementing a sheet for some kind of asset tracking and their value increases/deteriorations (and possible scenarios thereof) is feasible.
%At least not on my own.

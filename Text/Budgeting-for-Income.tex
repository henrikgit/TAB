\subsection{Budgeting for Income}
\label{subsec:budgeting-income}
% !TeX spellcheck = en_US

This very subsection of the guide simply exists if you decided to read up on budgeting for income.
This subsection actually is a placeholder.
Because once you understood how to budget for an expense, you have the knowledge to budget for an income item as well.
At this point, I do not think there is anything new to explain in regards to budgeting income items.
You would simply have go to the sheet \sheetname{BudgetINCitems} and apply the process detailed in \autoref{subsec:budgeting-expenses} in an analogical way.

\begin{itemize}
	\item Come December 31, the very last TODO-point on your list should be to write down the last pieces of information in regards to the last day of the year.
	So literally write down \programmcode{2016-12-31} into any cell that prints today's date, \eg in the \sheetname{Budget} sheet.
	\item Otherwise the next time you open that file later than December 31 of that year, the cell that prints today's date will obviously the date of that day.
	Hence January of the next year or the years to come perhaps.
	\item Proceed in an analogical fashion for every cell that prints dates through formulas.
	\item Otherwise all the budget-sheets which feature formulas based on the current month and/or date are faulty.
	Or rather, they do not show values which make sense.
	\item 
\end{itemize}
